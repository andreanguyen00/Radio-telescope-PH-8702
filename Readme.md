# Radio Telescope with Virgo and GNURadio Companion

This is the repository for our project for course PHYS8702: Prototyping and System Integrations. The project requires installation of [GNU Radio](https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/InstallingGR) and [Virgo](https://virgo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).

The flders are
1. Data: Raw data collected by using Virgo, including a `calibration.dat`, no signal data and `observation.dat`, signal data file.
2. Plot produced by Virgo and processed data `spectrum.csv`.
3. Script: Jupyter notebook for running Virgo.
